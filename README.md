Modified code samples from Reactive Programming with RxJava

This repository contains all the code through which I learned RxJava,
taken from the book [Reactive Programming with RxJava](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042228.do)
by Ben Christensen and Tomasz Nurkiewicz.

All the original samples in the book are writen for RxJava 1, but the
current latest version of RxJava is 2.
